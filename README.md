# Acer-Aspire-5-A515-51G-Opencore-EFI
This repo is made for documenting changes within my Opencore build.

It was **NOT** made to be used as a prebuilt EFI, and should be used for inspiration to creating your own Hackintosh. 

# The guide I was using: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/

I highly suggest you use this one, and this one only. While lengthy, it is best explained and even supports AMD processors.

Specs:

> CPU - Intel Core i5-8250U (Kaby Lake-R)

> iGPU - Intel UHD Graphics 620

> dGPU - Nvidia Geforce MX130 - turned off using SSDT-dGPU-Off

> RAM - 8GB 2400MHz Dual-Channel DDR4

> Storage - 240 GB SATA SSD

**I WILL NOT RESPOND TO ANY ISSUES IF YOU DECIDE TO USE IT AS A PREBUILT EFI.**
